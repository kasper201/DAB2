In this repository the program to load the database with up-to-date data from Formula 1 races can be found.
The code for the webpage was mostly written without prior experience with HTML, PHP, CSS and JavaScript, so it isn't the most efficient or clean code.

## How to run the importing program
The program is written for Linux systems and has been tested on Arch based systems.
It should work on other Linux distributions, but it hasn't been tested.
In theory, it could also work for windows but I didn't get that to work.

To run the program you need to have CURL installed.
